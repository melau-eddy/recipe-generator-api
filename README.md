# 🍽️ Meal Explorer – API Learning Project

This project is a simple web app built to help me learn and practice how to work with **APIs**. It uses **[TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)** – a free, open-source meal database API – to fetch and display meals based on different filters such as category, ingredient, or area.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project was to **train myself in API integration**, JSON parsing, and dynamic frontend rendering using JavaScript. It was a hands-on way to understand how to:

- Make HTTP requests
- Work with JSON data
- Use an external API effectively in a web project
- Display data dynamically in the UI
